# MeetIQ – Smart AI-Powered Conferencing

## Project Title & Description
**MeetIQ** is an AI-powered video conferencing platform that helps individuals, teams, and organizations run smarter, more productive meetings.

With MeetIQ, users can:
- Host secure **video and audio calls** (1:1 or group).
- Collaborate with **real-time chat and screen sharing**.
- Automatically generate **meeting transcripts, summaries, and action items** using AI.
- Get **live captions and translations** for international participants.

**Who it’s for:**
- Remote teams and businesses.
- Educators and online trainers.
- Freelancers and consultants.
- Communities that need accessible and inclusive communication.

**Why it matters:**
Meetings often waste time and lack follow-up. MeetIQ transforms meetings into actionable insights by combining **real-time communication** with **AI-powered productivity tools**.

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- React.js (Next.js) → responsive UI & SSR.
- Tailwind CSS + ShadCN/UI → fast, modern component styling.
- WebRTC API → video/audio calls.

### **Backend**
- Node.js + Express.js → signaling server & REST API.
- Socket.IO → real-time messaging and signaling.
- Mediasoup (optional, for scaling) → Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) for group calls.

### **Database**
- MongoDB (Mongoose) → user profiles, meetings, transcripts.

### **Authentication & Security**
- JWT (JSON Web Token) → secure user sessions.
- bcrypt → password hashing.

### **AI & NLP Services**
- Whisper / AssemblyAI → speech-to-text transcription.
- OpenAI GPT / Claude → meeting summaries & action items.
- Hugging Face Transformers → translations & sentiment analysis.

### **Other Tools**
- Docker → containerized deployment.
- GitHub Actions → CI/CD pipeline.
- CodeRabbit → AI-assisted PR review.

## AI Integration Strategy

### Code Generation
Use AI in **Cursor/Zed IDE** to scaffold:
- React components (`MeetingRoom`, `ChatBox`, `VideoTile`).
- Express.js routes (`/create-room`, `/join-room`).
- Mongoose models (`User`, `Meeting`, `Transcript`).

**Prompt Example:**
> Generate an Express route for creating a meeting with fields: title, hostId, participants, startTime, endTime.

---

### Testing Support
- Use AI to generate **Jest unit tests** and **Supertest integration tests**.
- Cover user authentication, API endpoints, and video signaling logic.

**Prompt Example:**
> Write Jest tests for the login controller ensuring valid JWT generation, invalid password handling, and expired token rejection.

---

### Documentation
- Auto-generate **inline comments and docstrings** for React components and backend services.
- Use AI to maintain `README.md`, setup guides, and API documentation.
- Generate **API docs** from OpenAPI spec with AI-assisted descriptions.

**Prompt Example:**
> Add docstrings to this WebRTC signaling function explaining how peers connect via ICE candidates.

---

### Context-Aware Techniques
- Feed **OpenAPI spec** to AI → generate typed API calls for frontend.
- Provide **Mongoose schemas** → generate CRUD services and validation logic.
- Use **file tree/diff prompts** in AI agents → generate PR summaries and suggest improvements.
